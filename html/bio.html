                        <p>I was born in Uccle in 1998. Growing up during the Golden Age of the Internet and Computers, I quickly developed a passion for everything that had something to do with it. My parents sent me to the Chiro (youth movement in Belgium), as I was literally stuck to the computer screen. Apparantly the light originating from a screen isn't the same as that from the sun. Today I'm still happily contributing to that Chiro by being a leader myself. I learned an instrument as well. I still rock my guitars almost every day!</p>
                        <p>It was during my early highschool years that I developed that passion. I made Youtube videos with my friends, and I was the editor. I started to learn using complicated software like Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro. I even started to practise with 3D software. Unfortunately, my friends had quit and thus I had to as well. But I never gave up on practising. I'm still using it and love to develop my knowledge of it. I hope I might be able to pick that hobby up again one day.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>Because of all this I wanted to become a VFX-Artist or something like that when I'd be grown up. I quickly realised though, that there weren't enough job oportunities in that niche. I was lucky enough to encounter a new aspect for my love for technology. I started to learn to hack, root and unlock my Android phone. I couldn't write one single piece of code, but it was clear I wanted to learn that sooner or later. I was amazed how much you could do with that skill asset. You could write apps, operatings system, instructions, and all other kinds of software. How cool is that?</p>
                        <p>In the last 2 years of highschool, I still used my skills from what I learned from making youtube videos. I edited a lot of videos for our "Free Podium", and received a huge amount of compliments with my work. My second piece of work was a website I had made for our school prom. I learned to code it all by myself. But the coolest part? I could combine 2 things I loved doing into one. From that moment on, I realised I wanted to learn as much as possible about all aspects of technology. Applied Computer Sciences had it all in for me. I'm curious to what this journey has in store for me, and I'm happily looking towards the future.</p>

                <p>This is where it all began. Youtube was becoming very popular and me and my best friend worshipped youtubers like Freddiew and CorridorDigital (VFX Artists). Inspired by them, we grabbed a camera and began making videos ourselves. Our first Video became known as <em>Shot of the Assassin</em>, and we didn't stop with that.</p>

Learning Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro is something that I'd never regret. And even on this day, I'm still practicing in my spare time. Design is something I truly love, but I wasn't too sure if I'd want to do that for the rest of my life.</p>

                <p>During my last 2 years in high school, I really started to know what I wanted to do. For our annual FreePodium (which I helped organize), I had made a lot of funny, well edited, videos. Everybody loved them, and even our teachers told me I had a lot of capacity and talent, especially because I learned all those things on my own. One of those videos was a music parody of a well known Ghentian rapper, Jerome, who was teaching at our school at that time. When he said he'd hire me, I was so happy!</p>

                <p>For our annual prom (my last year of high school), a website had to be made, but no one knew how. At that time, I was busy learning code, which I was fascinated by thanks to a good IT friend. Thus, I said I wanted to make the site. So I learned some basic HTML and CSS and before I knew it, I made my very own site! It wasn't that spectacular of course, but it was cool! And the best part, it was a combination of 2 things I love! Code and Design.</p>

                <h2>Start-up of Leunes Media</h2>
                <p>It all began during the summer of 2017, when some people of my youth movement began to recognise my filmwork. It were they that said I had to do something with all these talents. So i made my own page, and before I knew it some friends asked me if I could make an aftermovie of their event. I did that, and everybody was super hyped. I made another one of our youth movement camp, and even bought my own camera. Now, after a few other projects, Leunes Media has become something I'm very proud of. I can code, make movies, do some photography all under one name. And I hope to do it for a long time. <em>On to the next chapter!</em></p>
