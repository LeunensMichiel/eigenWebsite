                        <p>I was born in Uccle in 1998. Growing up during the Golden Age of the Internet and Computers, I quickly developed a passion for everything that had something to do with it. My parents sent me to the Chiro (youth movement in Belgium), as I was literally stuck to the computer screen. Apparantly the light originating from a screen isn't the same as that from the sun. Today I'm still happily contributing to that Chiro by being a leader myself. I learned an instrument as well. I still rock my guitars almost every day!</p>
                        <p>It was during my early highschool years that I developed that passion. I made Youtube videos with my friends, and I was the editor. I started to learn using complicated software like Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro. I even started to practise with 3D software. Unfortunately, my friends had quit and thus I had to as well. But I never gave up on practising. I'm still using it and love to develop my knowledge of it. I hope I might be able to pick that hobby up again one day.</p>

                        <p>Because of all this I wanted to become a VFX-Artist or something like that when I'd be grown up. I quickly realised though, that there weren't enough job oportunities in that niche. I was lucky enough to encounter a new aspect for my love for technology. I started to learn to hack, root and unlock my Android phone. I couldn't write one single piece of code, but it was clear I wanted to learn that sooner or later. I was amazed how much you could do with that skill asset. You could write apps, operatings system, instructions, and all other kinds of software. How cool is that?</p>
                        <p>In the last 2 years of highschool, I still used my skills from what I learned from making youtube videos. I edited a lot of videos for our "Free Podium", and received a huge amount of compliments with my work. My second piece of work was a website I had made for our school prom. I learned to code it all by myself. But the coolest part? I could combine 2 things I loved doing into one. From that moment on, I realised I wanted to learn as much as possible about all aspects of technology. Applied Computer Sciences had it all in for me. I'm curious to what this journey has in store for me, and I'm happily looking towards the future.</p>
